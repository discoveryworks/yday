## Current State of `yday` Project

### Project Structure
- **Repository**: `/Users/developer/workspace/yday` (separate from other projects)
- **Type**: Node.js CLI tool for git retrospective analysis
- **Status**: Phase 1 implementation (core semantic analysis)

### Key Components

**Package Files:**
- `package.json` - npm package config with commander, chalk, yaml dependencies
- `bin/yday` - CLI entry point with comprehensive flag support
- `src/index.js` - Main application logic and routing
- `src/time-periods.js` - Smart time handling (Monday → Friday, etc.)
- `src/git-analysis.js` - git-standup integration and commit parsing
- `src/semantic.js` - Semantic commit analysis (extracted from yday-semantic)
- `src/timeline.js` - Placeholder for Alastair-style timeline view
- `src/shadow.js` - Placeholder for shadow work analysis

### Current Implementation Status

**✅ Working Features:**
- Basic semantic analysis of commits across multiple repos
- Smart time period handling (yesterday, Friday on Monday, etc.)
- Full git-standup integration with -d, -u, -A, -B flags
- New `--on` flag for specific day (single day, N days ago)
- Comprehensive CLI help with implementation status
- Verbose debugging mode
- Dependency checking (git-standup, gh CLI)

**⚠️ Partially Working:**
- Default behavior (`yday` with no args) - fixed to show "recent work" instead of strict yesterday
- Time period descriptions and semantic summaries

**❌ Not Yet Implemented:**
- `--alastair` timeline view (MTWRFSs pattern)
- `--shadow` mode (GitHub project tracking gaps)
- Configuration file support (~/.config/yday.yml)

### Recent Issues Fixed
1. **"undefined" parent directory** - Fixed default path handling
2. **Missing commits** - Changed default from strict "yesterday" to "recent work" (last 24 hours)
3. **Author filtering** - Removed unnecessary complexity per YAGNI principle
4. **Flag semantics** - Clarified `-d` as "since N days ago" vs new `--on` as "exactly N days ago"

### README.lint Compliance Issue
Current README uses 📜 emojis instead of required 🌸 structure. Needs to be updated to:
- 🌸 Why use yday?
- 🌸🌸 Who benefits from this?
- 🌸🌸🌸 What does it do?
- 🌸🌸🌸🌸 How do I use it?
- 🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸 Extras

### Architecture Decision
Per ADR-001, yday is extracted as standalone npm package separate from dot-rot to maintain clean separation of concerns:
- **dot-rot** = system configuration only
- **yday** = shareable development tool
- **gday** (in dot-rot) = personal workflow orchestration

### Next Steps
1. Fix any remaining issues with default behavior
2. Implement `--alastair` timeline view
3. Implement `--shadow` mode with GitHub integration
4. Update README to be README.lint compliant
5. Update dot-rot to use extracted yday package
